Hey there! My name is Tony, and I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Washington, Bothell getting my Master's
degree in Computer Science & Software Engineering (CSSE). I graduated from the University of California, Merced in 2020 with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and I am working  towards obtaining my PhD. At a glance, my main research interests are in AI and Game Development (specifically, through the use of Data Oriented Design (DOD)). I'd like to code in a world where our programs are naturally CPU efficient, still maintain a high level of expression, and not cause migraines in writing and maintenance.

Outside of my education, I enjoy video games (obviously), and occasionally doodle and write music from time to time when inspiration kicks in.
